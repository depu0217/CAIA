These are answers based on CAIA textbooks. It's based on my current knowledge, which means some information has been deleted for common sense



4.1. Demonstrate knowledge of the characteristics of return distributions
1. Recognize ex ante and ex post return distributions
    Ex post returns are realized outcomes rather than anticipated outcomes
    Ex ante returns are before the sene
    Using Ex post to forecast Ex ante conditions: 
    a. The return distribution must be stationary through time (expected return and dispersion no change over time)
    b. The sample of past observations must be sufficiently large to be likely to form a reasonably accurate representation of the process


2. Recognize the importance of normal distribution in statistical analysis
It tends to approximate many distributions observed in nature

3. Describe the characteristics of lognormal distribution
Two approaches to model returns
Use log returns and assume that they are normally distributed
Add 1 to the simple returns and assume it has a lognormal distribution

4.2. Demonstrate knowledge of moments of return distributions
1-4. Explain the first four raw moments of return distributions
nth raw moment: \doubleE[R^n]
1) 1st raw moment: the central tendency of the variable. It can be calculated using two approaches
\doubleE[R] = \sum_i \doubleP_i\times R_i
Or Mean = 1/n\sum_i R_i
2) 2nd central moment: variance
3) 3rd central moment: \doubleE[(R-\mu)^3]. We can define skewness to a measure of asymmetry, which is dimensionless
Skewness = 3rd central moment / \sigma^3
4) 4th central moment. Kurtosis is an indicator of the peaks and tails of a distribution. High values of kurtosis, fatter tails!
Kurtosis = 4th central moment / \sigma^4
